# 🐾 n8n Automation Workflows for Animal Advocates

This repository contains a collection of ready-to-use JSON workflows for [n8n](https://n8n.io/) — the open-source workflow automation tool — tailored specifically for the needs of animal advocacy organizations, campaigns, and grassroots initiatives.

These workflows are designed to save time, boost impact, and empower advocates through streamlined automation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Set Up n8n

Choose a deployment method:

- **RepoCloud.io** – _Recommended_  
  One-click deploy of the open-source community version. A great balance between simplicity and cost.  
  👉 [https://repocloud.io](https://repocloud.io)

- **n8n Cloud**  
  Official managed hosting by the n8n team — easiest to get started, but more expensive over time.  
  👉 [https://n8n.io/](https://n8n.io/)

- **Self-hosted (DIY) Options**
  - **Local Install:** via `npm` or native app
  - **Docker:** run n8n in a container
  - **Other VPS/Cloud Hosts:** e.g. DigitalOcean, Render, Railway

For setup instructions, see the [n8n docs](https://docs.n8n.io/)

### 2. Import a Workflow

- In the n8n editor UI, click the **menu icon** → **Import from File**
- Upload the `.json` file from this repository
- Customize nodes (e.g. add your credentials or tweak filters)

### 3. Activate & Automate!

Once configured, you can activate workflows to run manually, on a schedule, or via triggers (like webhooks, form entries, RSS updates, etc.).
