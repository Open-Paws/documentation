# 🐾 n8n Automation Workflows for Animal Advocates

We've built a collection of ready-to-use workflows for n8n (a fair-code workflow automation tool) tailored specifically for the needs of animal advocacy organizations, campaigns, and grassroots initiatives.

These workflows are designed to save time, boost impact, and empower advocates through streamlined automation.

### 🏢 For Organizations & Teams (Recommended)

### 👤 For Individuals & Power Users

If you're working solo and/or comfortable with basic server setups, self-hosting will be cheaper and more flexible:

* **One-Click Deploy (Best balance of ease & price for less technical users):**
  *[RepoCloud](https://repocloud.io) – one-click deployment of the community plan (easier set up, less customisation options)
  *[Elestio](https://elest.io/) - one-click deployment of the community plan (more customisation options, but slightly more difficult to set up)

* **Local or No-KYC VPS Hosting (recommended for security-concious users):**

  * **Local Install:** via the official [self-hosted AI starter kit](https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit) from n8n (best option for users with high security needs).
  * **No-KYC Cloud VPS:** via a [no-KYC VPS provider](https://kycnot.me/?categories=vps), paying with crypto for maximum privacy (less secure than local hosting, but more secure than regular clous hosting).
