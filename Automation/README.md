# 🐾 n8n Automation Workflows for Animal Advocates

This repository contains a collection of ready-to-use JSON workflows for [n8n](https://n8n.io/) — the open-source workflow automation tool — tailored specifically for the needs of animal advocacy organizations, campaigns, and grassroots initiatives.

These workflows are designed to save time, boost impact, and empower advocates through streamlined automation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Set Up n8n

Choose a deployment method:

- **RepoCloud.io** – _Recommended for less technical users_  
  One-click deploy of the open-source community version. A great balance between simplicity and cost for less technical users, but potentially less secure than self-hosting for more technical users with greater security needs.  
  👉 [https://repocloud.io](https://repocloud.io)

- **Self-hosted Options** - _Recommended for security conscious users_
  - **Local Install:** via the official [self-hosted AI starter kit](https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit) from n8n. Runs locally on your device, keeping all data secure. Requires extra set-up to allow triggers from third-party applications.
  - **Cloud Hosting:** via a [no-KYC VPS provider](https://kycnot.me/?categories=vps) paid for with crypto. Consider this option if you need an untraceable cloud-hosted instance with full control over your security settings. Requires some techincal proficiency to set up.

For setup instructions, see the [n8n docs](https://docs.n8n.io/)

### 2. Import a Workflow

- In the n8n editor UI, click the **menu icon** → **Import from File**
- Upload the `.json` file from this repository
- Customize nodes (e.g. add your credentials or tweak filters)

### 3. Activate & Automate!

Once configured, you can activate workflows to run manually, on a schedule, or via triggers (like webhooks, form entries, RSS updates, etc.).
